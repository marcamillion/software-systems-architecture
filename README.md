# software-systems-architecture

As a software developer, we always build systems. Quite frequently, it may be systems we don't have a deep understanding of (architecturally-speaking). This repository is to serve as a collection of the architecture of a variety of systems.

This is a running list of all the systems that you can find the architecture for in this project:

* Shopping Carts
* Basic Marketplace
* Web Crawler
* Stock Portfolio

To contribute a system, simply create a new PR with a new system, and add that list to this ReadMe.
